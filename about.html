              This game was developed by the Mason Lab, in the Neurobiology department of the University of Chicago in collaboration with Radboud University Nijmegen.

              The goal of this game is to collect data to understand Fitt's Law. Different from other web applications, our game does not require
              a mouse click, and therefore isolates the motor component that is relevant to the task of reaching towards a target quickly. As such,
              in addition to study Fitt's Law, this game assesses the dynamics of planning fast movements more broadly.

              The data collected in this game is anonymous.
